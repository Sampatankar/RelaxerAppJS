16/20: CSS Animations &amp; setTimeout - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This app is to stimulate breathing with a visual director to tell you when to breathe in, hold and breathe out.

The app will utilise an aesthetically pleasing styling via CSS.  There will be an animated pointer which will simulate breathing patterns. Javascript will be used to create the breathing animation effect.

This is the 16th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
